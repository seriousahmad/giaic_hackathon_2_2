The resulting UI must be exceptionally beautiful, modern, and professional — evoking the polish of top-tier commercial apps \\(like Todoist, Notion, or Linear\\). Every pixel, interaction, and flow must feel intentional, elegant, and delightful, while fully implementing the 5 core todo features \\(Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete\\), Better Auth \\(signup/signin\\), protected routes, and seamless JWT-secured API integration.\nSuccess criteria:\n\nDelivers a stunning, jaw-dropping UI that instantly stands out in hackathon judging — clean, sophisticated, and emotionally engaging.\nAchieves true professional excellence: flawless typography, perfect spacing rhythm, subtle depth \\(soft shadows, glassmorphism\\), premium color harmony, and joyful micro-interactions.\nCovers every screen/state: Auth \\(Sign Up/Sign In\\), Protected Dashboard \\(task list, empty state, loading\\), Add Task modal, Edit Task modal, instant visual feedback on all actions.\nProvides crystal-clear textual wireframes, precise layout grids, exact Tailwind class recommendations, component hierarchy, and behavior descriptions — leaving zero room for interpretation error.\nDefines a bulletproof, typed API client with automatic JWT handling and graceful auth redirects.\nEnsures pixel-perfect responsiveness across mobile \\(320px+\\), tablet, and desktop with fluid, adaptive layouts.\nGenerates a flawless Markdown file \\(v1_frontend.spec.md\\) in specs/ui/ — so complete that the Frontend Engineer agent can build a world-class, demo-ready frontend\"\"\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *\\(mandatory\\)*\n\n### User Story 1 - User Authentication \\(Sign Up/Sign In\\) \\(Priority: P1\\)\n\nA new user visits the application and needs to create an account or sign in to access their todo lists. The authentication flow must be intuitive and secure, providing immediate access to their personal todo dashboard after successful authentication.\n\n**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundational requirement that enables all other functionality. Without authentication, users cannot access their personal todo data or use the application.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing the sign up and sign in flows independently and successfully redirecting to the protected dashboard, delivering the core value of a personalized todo management experience.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a user is on the landing page, **When** they click \"\"Sign Up\"\", **Then** they are presented with a clean, professional sign-up form with email and password fields\n2. **Given** a user fills in valid credentials, **When** they submit the sign-up form, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to their protected dashboard\n3. **Given** a user has an account, **When** they visit the sign-in page and enter valid credentials, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to their protected dashboard\n4. **Given** a user enters invalid credentials, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they receive a clear, user-friendly error message\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Todo Management Dashboard \\(Priority: P1\\)\n\nAn authenticated user accesses their dashboard to view, create, update, and manage their todos. The dashboard provides a clean, intuitive interface with all core todo functionality: Add, Delete, Update, View, and Mark Complete.\n\n**Why this priority**: This represents the core value proposition of the application - managing todos effectively. All primary functionality must be available in an intuitive interface.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating, viewing, updating, marking complete, and deleting todos, delivering the complete todo management experience.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an authenticated user is on the dashboard, **When** they view their todos, **Then** they see a clean, well-organized list with proper visual hierarchy\n2. **Given** an authenticated user wants to add a new todo, **When** they click \"\"Add Todo\"\" or use the appropriate UI element, **Then** they can enter the todo details and save it to their list\n3. **Given** an authenticated user has todos, **When** they mark a todo as complete, **Then** the todo is visually updated to reflect its completed state\n4. **Given** an authenticated user wants to edit a todo, **When** they click edit, **Then** they can modify the todo details and save changes\n5. **Given** an authenticated user wants to delete a todo, **When** they click delete, **Then** the todo is removed from their list with appropriate confirmation if needed\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Responsive Design & Visual Polish \\(Priority: P2\\)\n\nUsers access the application across different devices \\(mobile, tablet, desktop\\) and expect a consistent, visually stunning experience with professional design elements, proper typography, and delightful micro-interactions.\n\n**Why this priority**: Professional-grade visual design and responsive behavior are critical for hackathon judging and creating the premium experience described in the requirements.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying the UI renders correctly across different screen sizes \\(mobile 320px+, tablet, desktop\\) with proper layout adjustments and visual consistency.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a user accesses the application on a mobile device, **When** they interact with the UI, **Then** the layout adapts appropriately with touch-friendly elements\n2. **Given** a user accesses the application on different screen sizes, **When** they navigate through the app, **Then** the typography, spacing, and visual elements maintain professional quality\n3. **Given** a user performs actions in the application, **When** they interact with UI elements, **Then** they experience subtle, delightful micro-interactions and visual feedback\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - API Integration with JWT Authentication \\(Priority: P2\\)\n\nThe frontend seamlessly communicates with the backend API using JWT tokens for authentication, automatically handling token refresh and redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.\n\n**Why this priority**: Secure API communication with proper authentication is essential for protecting user data and ensuring the application functions as a complete system.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying API calls include proper JWT headers, successful responses are processed correctly, and unauthorized responses trigger appropriate redirects.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an authenticated user performs an action, **When** the frontend makes an API call, **Then** the JWT token is automatically included in the request headers\n2. **Given** a user''s JWT token expires, **When** they attempt an API call, **Then** they are gracefully redirected to the sign-in page with an appropriate message\n3. **Given** the frontend receives API responses, **When** the data is processed, **Then** the UI updates accordingly to reflect the current state\n\n---\n\n### User Story 5 - Loading States and Empty States \\(Priority: P3\\)\n\nUsers experience smooth transitions and appropriate feedback during loading states, and receive helpful guidance when their todo list is empty.\n\n**Why this priority**: Proper loading and empty state handling improves user experience and prevents confusion during data fetching or when starting fresh.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by observing loading indicators during API calls and verifying appropriate empty state messaging when no todos exist.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** data is being loaded from the API, **When** the user waits for content, **Then** they see appropriate loading indicators\n2. **Given** a user has no todos, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** they see a helpful empty state with guidance on how to add their first todo\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the API is temporarily unavailable?\n- How does the system handle multiple simultaneous requests from the same user?\n- What occurs when a user tries to access protected routes without a valid JWT token?\n- How does the UI behave when network connectivity is poor?\n- What happens when a user tries to mark a todo as complete that no longer exists on the server?\n\n## Requirements *\\(mandatory\\)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide sign-up functionality with email and password validation\n- **FR-002**: System MUST provide sign-in functionality with secure credential validation\n- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users attempting to access protected routes to the sign-in page\n- **FR-004**: System MUST display a protected dashboard for authenticated users\n- **FR-005**: System MUST allow authenticated users to add new todos with title and optional description\n- **FR-006**: System MUST allow authenticated users to delete existing todos\n- **FR-007**: System MUST allow authenticated users to update existing todo details\n- **FR-008**: System MUST allow authenticated users to mark todos as complete/incomplete\n- **FR-009**: System MUST display all authenticated user''s todos in an organized list view\n- **FR-010**: System MUST include JWT tokens automatically in all API requests\n- **FR-011**: System MUST handle API responses and update UI accordingly\n- **FR-012**: System MUST provide appropriate loading states during API operations\n- **FR-013**: System MUST display helpful empty states when no todos exist\n- **FR-014**: System MUST provide responsive design that works on mobile \\(320px+\\), tablet, and desktop\n- **FR-015**: System MUST implement graceful error handling with user-friendly messages\n- **FR-016**: System MUST provide smooth, delightful micro-interactions for user actions\n- **FR-017**: System MUST maintain consistent typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy across all screens\n- **FR-018**: System MUST implement proper form validation for all user inputs\n- **FR-019**: System MUST handle JWT token expiration and redirect to sign-in page appropriately\n- **FR-020**: System MUST provide a logout functionality that clears authentication state\n\n### Key Entities *\\(include if feature involves data\\)*\n\n- **User**: Represents an authenticated user with email, authentication tokens, and personal todo data\n- **Todo**: Represents a user''s task with properties like title, description, completion status, creation date, and owner reference\n\n## Success Criteria *\\(mandatory\\)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users can complete sign-up or sign-in process in under 30 seconds\n- **SC-002**: Dashboard loads and displays todos within 2 seconds under normal network conditions\n- **SC-003**: All UI elements are responsive and functional across screen sizes from 320px to 1920px width\n- **SC-004**: 95% of users successfully complete the primary task \\(adding their first todo\\) on first attempt\n- **SC-005**: Loading states are displayed within 500ms of initiating API requests\n- **SC-006**: Error messages are clear and actionable, leading to 90% successful resolution of user issues\n- **SC-007**: The UI achieves visual consistency with professional design standards \\(to be evaluated by design review\\)\n- **SC-008**: All interactive elements provide appropriate visual feedback within 200ms of user action\n- **SC-009**: Authentication state is properly maintained across browser sessions until explicit logout\n- **SC-010**: The application achieves a visually stunning, professional appearance comparable to top-tier commercial apps like Todoist, Notion, or Linear \\(as evaluated by hackathon judges\\)\")",
